# Thank you for the memories, internet

Today I googled myself and it was amazing. I found the [first website I ever made](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~tmd94/), for my first freshman term at Drexel.

I also found some super great old photos of a younger me, and was reminded of some really cool past projects like my freshman design project - the Biomedical Sensing Device - and my senior design project - [Dancing with Drones](http://www.cci.drexel.edu/seniordesign/2016_2017/DancingDrones/DancingDroneProjectPage.html).
